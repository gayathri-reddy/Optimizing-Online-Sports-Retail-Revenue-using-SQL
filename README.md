# Optimizing-Online-Sports-Retail-Revenue-using-SQL

Sports clothing and athleisure attire is a huge industry, worth approximately $193 billion in 2021 with a strong growth forecast over the next decade!

For the DataCamp project, I analyzed the online sports clothing company's data using SQL. The company is specially interested in how it can improve the revenue. I deep dive into product data such as pricing, reviews, descriptions, ratings, revenue, website traffic to produce recommendations.

Findings:

- Adidas is making more revenue than Nike.       
- Adidas items generate more total revenue regardless of pricing category. Specially Elite Adidas products worth morth than 129 dollars typically generate the highest revenue.      
- Not only Adidas products generates more revenue, but these products are also heavily discounted(~33%) compared to Nike.      
4. There is strong positive correlation between revenue and reviews.And the first quarter of calender year has more reviews.    
5. We have total amount of 3117 products. In that 2700 are footwear products, which accounts for around 85% of company's stock.
